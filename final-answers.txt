(9) (describe insights from figure):
looking at the plot, I can see fatalities~magnitude. 
The majority of earth quakes, have 0 or very few fatalities
despite the magnitude. With that said, there are a handful 
of earthquake with high magnitudes that have extremely high
fatalities. 

(10) (describe insights from figure):
I see a lot of earthquakes around the perimeters of the continents.
Additionally, earthquakes follow mountain ranges. There are few
earth quakes in the middle of landmasses. It looks like
the majority of high magnitude earth quakes happen in the ocean.


TASK 5: (describe interesting finding):
I choose to look into years with unusally high number of earthquakes.
2016 had the highest count of signficiant earthquakes. Which
is fasinating to me because, I lived during that year and didn't
realize that anything unusally with earthquakes was happening.



TASK 6: 
(1) For me, the webscraping and data cleaning was the hardest.
Everything else fits into a nicely little pattern once the data is ready.
But getting and cleaning the data is like tamming a wild animal.


(2) Yes or No: Yes

- (2a) I used GPT to help me with syntax. I am most familiary with R, and I kept writing R syntax.
I used GPT to help me get the correct arguments for python.

- (2b) i.e. I wrote head(df, 5), but in python it is df.head(5). 

- (2c) It was helpful, it saved me a lot of time having to go read documentation. It was unhelpful,
because it kept wanting to through generic arguments into the result. And I had to go in and change
the arguments to be specific to my data.

(3) I took the this in two sittings. And I think I was about 4.5 hrs collectivily.
